# TestJavaScript

A JavaScript testing playground based roughly on the mozillia JS tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript

Workable code is written on each topic to demonstrate use of JavaScript in the topic area. The code written is generally meant to work in node.js as a side effect of it being easy to run as a script in atom.

## Installation

Javascript can be run on any modern browser. However, some of the code requires the html file to be opened on a server. For that purpose, WinNMP was used to create a local virtual server, and the necessary files put inside the server's project files. Since atom used to run scripts, installing node.js is also necessary.
