# TestJavaScript

A JavaScript testing playground based roughly on the mozillia JS tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript

Workable code is written on each topic to demonstrate use of JavaScript in the topic area. The code written is generally meant to work in node.js as a side effect of it being easy to run as a script in atom.

## Installation

This project was written in the atom text editor. Javascript can be run on any modern browser. However, some of the code requires the html file to be opened on a server. For that purpose, WinNMP was used to create a local virtual server, and the necessary files put inside the server's project files. Since atom used to run scripts, installing node.js is also necessary.

* [atom_1.40.1](https://atom.io/)
* [WinNMP 19.06](https://winnmp.wtriple.com/)
* [node.js 10.16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
