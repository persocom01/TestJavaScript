// An export aggregator collects all the exported modules in a single file.

// Demonstrated here with a class export, as putting all exports in a file into
// a single object makes the syntax when exporting and importing easier.
export { Mod2Class } from './myModule2.js'
export { Mod3Class } from './myModule3.js'
